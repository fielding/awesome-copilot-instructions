## 🛠 **Contribution Guidelines**

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page to create a copy in your GitHub account.

### 2. **Clone Your Fork**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/copilot-instructions.git
cd copilot-instructions
```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. **Add or Update Instruction Files**

- **Adding New Instruction Files:**
  - Navigate to the appropriate language folder within `instructions/`.
  - If the folder doesn't exist, create it (e.g., `instructions/ruby/`).
  - Add your instruction file with a descriptive name (e.g., `rails.md` for Ruby on Rails instructions).

- **Improving Existing Instruction Files:**
  - Edit the relevant `.md` files within the language folders.

### 5. **Follow the Instruction File Format**

Please ensure your instruction file:

- **Is in Plain Text Format:** As GitHub Copilot processes instruction files as plain text, avoid using Markdown formatting within the instruction files.
- **Contains Clear Instructions:** Provide a list of clear, concise instructions.
- **Uses Descriptive Naming:** Name your file appropriately (e.g., `base.md`, `numpy.md`, `react.md`).

**Example of an Instruction File (`instructions/python/numpy.md`):**

```
Prefer using NumPy for numerical computations.
Use vectorized operations instead of loops where possible.
Import NumPy using the alias 'np'.
Include comments explaining complex mathematical operations.
```

### 6. **Update the Language Folder's README.md (If Applicable)**

- Add your instruction file to the list of available instructions in the `README.md` of the language folder.
- Provide a brief description of what your instruction file covers.

### 7. **Commit Your Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add [language/framework] code generation instructions"
```

### 8. **Push to Your Fork**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 9. **Create a Pull Request**

- Go to the original repository on GitHub.
- Click on **Pull Requests** and then **New Pull Request**.
- Select your fork and branch as the source, and submit the pull request.

### 10. **Wait for Review**

- One of the maintainers will review your pull request.
- Please respond to any feedback or requests for changes.

## ✅ **Contribution Checklist**

Before submitting your contribution, please ensure that:

- [ ] Your instruction file is in plain text without Markdown formatting.
- [ ] The content is clear, concise, and free of typos.
- [ ] You have tested the instructions with GitHub Copilot.
- [ ] You have updated the `README.md` in the language folder if applicable.
- [ ] Your contribution adheres to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🛠 **Using the Instruction Files**

To help users utilize your instruction files, consider including instructions on how to combine instruction files.

**Example:**

To combine the base Python instructions with NumPy-specific instructions:

```bash
cd instructions/python
cat base.md numpy.md > ../../.vscode/copilot-instructions.md
```

**Note:** This command concatenates `base.md` and `numpy.md` into a single file named `copilot-instructions.md` located in the `.vscode/` directory of your project. Users can then reference this file in their VS Code settings.
